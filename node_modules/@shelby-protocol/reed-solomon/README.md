# @shelby-protocol/reed-solomon

## Description

This package provides a WASM-based implementation of Reed–Solomon encoding and decoding.

## Installation

```bash
# From your package or app
pnpm install @shelby-protocol/reed-solomon
```

## Building

Because this is a TypeScript package shim relying on native bindings, you must build it before consuming it in our turborepo setup:

```bash
# From the @shelby-protocol/reed-solomon package directory
pnpm run build
```

This will compile `src/index.ts` into `dist/index.js` and update the `package.json` `main`/`module` entries. Only after building can other packages import `@shelby-protocol/reed-solomon` successfully.

## Why the shim?

- **Type safety**: We provide TypeScript type signatures for all core functions.
- **Monorepo compatibility**: Ensures consistent import paths and build artifacts across workspaces.
